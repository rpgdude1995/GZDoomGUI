# GZDoomGUI
An GUI to Manage Weapons and Inventory in GZdoom

/////SETUP////////
Requires Zscript 4.7.0 or later (Which should translate to GZdoom 4.7.0)

Be aware that this hud only works properly with inventory items when altHUD option enabled in options and just under the max screen size (when screen has no UI this software breaks down and dosent manage inventory properly)

/////KNOW ISSUES////////

-the double click is very glitchy

-sprite scaling is primitive and causes problems with some sprites

-the screen draws items at a hardcoded virtual resolution of 1280x720 therefore does not properly support 4x3, 5x4, 16x10 etc.
